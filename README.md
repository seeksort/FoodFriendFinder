# FriendFinder

(Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap) A website for matching dining companions. Uses server-side routing to serve HTML and JSON (for an API), and to determine and return the best friend match.

The tricky bits: routing and figuring out relative paths (for the static CSS file). But it was nice to spend some time with jQuery again.
